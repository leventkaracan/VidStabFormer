# VidStabFormer: Full-frame Video Stabilization via Spatial-Temporal Transformers

Offical implementation of "VidStabFormer: Full-frame Video Stabilization via Spatial-Temporal Transformers"

Preparation: 

Clone https://github.com/sniklaus/pytorch-pwc inside model folder. We used a modified version of its backwarp function. 

Follow the CVPR2020 paper implementation of "Yu and Ramamoorthi, 2020" in https://github.com/alex04072000/FuSta/tree/main for creating warping field of any video. 

run test.py for generating the stable video.
